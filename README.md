##Project Euler Solutions

Every week (or close to that), I plan on taking on a new math challenge from Project Euler and solving it using Javascript and testing best practices. 

You can view my solutions broken down by problem here, and writeups describing my thoughts at http://jorshasaur.us

####Steps to run the project

1. Clone the repo

2. Run ```npm install```

3. ```grunt``` to run all tasks, or ```grunt watch``` to watch the folder for changes.
